how i used JS and bootstrap
In this project i used JS on the Reviews page, to add new div with new review after the form is filled and clicked submit
Bootstrap i used on gallery page to insert a nice looking carousel with pictures. Also on reviews and contact page i used some form fields from bootstrap.
